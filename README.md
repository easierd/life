# Terminal Game of Life (C)

A simple **Conway's Game of Life** implemented in C and rendered directly in the terminal using ANSI escape codes.

---

## 📜 Features

* Terminal-based rendering with green "alive" cells
* Modular design:

  * **board.h/board.c** – simulation state & update rules
  * **board\_state.h/board\_state.c** – predefined shapes (e.g., glider)
  * **screen.h/screen.c** – ANSI escape code rendering
  * **main.c** – simulation loop
* Automatically fits the terminal window
* Uses **AddressSanitizer** for debugging and memory safety
* Makefile build system

---

## 🎮 How to Build & Run

### Requirements

* GCC or Clang
* POSIX-compatible terminal (Linux, macOS, WSL, BSD)

### Build

```bash
make
```

### Run

```bash
./main
```

The simulation will run for **100 iterations** by default.

---

## 🕹 Controls

There are no live controls in this version.
Simulation runs automatically once launched.

To:

* Increase iterations → edit `ITERATIONS` in `main.c`
* Add new shapes → edit `board_state.h/board_state.c`

## 🧩 Example Pattern – Glider

```
 . O .
 . . O
 O O O
```

Replicates diagonally across the board.

## 🧠 Implementation Details

### 1. **Simulation Rules**

Implements Conway’s standard rules:

1. Any live cell with <2 neighbors → dies (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with 2–3 neighbors → survives
3. Any live cell with >3 neighbors → dies (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors → becomes alive (reproduction)

### 2. **Terminal Rendering**

* Uses ANSI escape codes to:

  * Clear screen
  * Hide cursor
  * Draw alive cells in green
  * Alive cells drawn using two space characters `"  "` to keep proportions.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* No live editing or interactive controls
* Relies on ANSI escape codes — won’t work in non-ANSI terminals

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add more predefined patterns
* Live user interaction (pause, edit, reset)
